# Secure-User-authentication-using-Flask-login
I made a small project on user login, log out and register (sign up) which uses flask_login to keep pages secure. The Flask login helps to maintain the status of the user login and log out and dependent on that the secret webpages can be displayed to the logged-in user. This allows users to access webpages only if they are logged in.
